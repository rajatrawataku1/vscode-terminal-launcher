This extension comes really handy for any project in which you may need to have one or more terminal window open while developing. i.e.: Run Unit tests in watch mode, transpile your code using babel, ...etc.

This extension allows you to set up and configure your projects with the terminal windows and commands that you want to run and it would launch them for you through the VSCode integrated terminals.

See the demos below.

## Installation

Press F1 in VSCode, type

```
ext install vscode-terminal-launcher
```

## Usage

### Save Project

First you'll need to save a new project along with the scripts that you wish to run.

### Edit the list of project

To easily add more projects, edit, or re-cofigure a previously added project. you can edit the projects.json file yourself with the following command and the json file will open up ready for editiing.

For each group a separate terminal window is used and for each command inside a group a split terminal is opened.
